	<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p> Hi My name is Chris and I am a newly minted Full Stack Web Developer. I attended UC Berkeley and graduated with a degree in Political Econonmy. Right out of college, I started my career in software sales and then transitioned over to customer support for an online investment firm. I decided to learn how to code because I wanted to stay in tune with technology and the ever changing world. I truly believe that one day, the world will be so immersed in technology that all of humanity will depend on it for their everyday lives. Eventually, I want to use my technical and entrepreneurial skills to get into product and build beautiful user experiences for people. </p>
